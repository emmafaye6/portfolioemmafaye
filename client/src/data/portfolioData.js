      "The objective for this project was clear and simple : display relevant projects that I've developed through the months and the skills that came from them. The rest was a free play area. I had fun with the design, settling on a playful and lighthearted look & feel. I had as much fun with the code itself, trying to use all I've learned during my degree, while also learning to set up a very simple server and mongodb database. ",
